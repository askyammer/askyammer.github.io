Admins can use this document to assist with looking up data on your
users, as well as being able to perform an audit of the users who are
members of your network. Additionally, admins can perform user
maintenance based off the current state of your users based on this
data.

### Performing the Export

Yammer Network Admins have the ability to export user information for
their network. To export the data use the Export Users feature.
(Settings > Network Admin > Export Users). There are two options available for the
User Export:

* Export All Users: This will export every user on the Yammer Network
* Export All users since – to specify a date range

<br>
### Contents of the Export

User Export will export the data into a zip file containing a CSV file and txt files. There will be five files within the User export Folder:

* Admins.csv: Contains a list of all Network and Verified admins.

* Networks.csv: Contains data pertaining to your network.

* Users.csv: Contains a list of all users on the network within the specified time period.

* log.txt: Contains a summary of the number of users who were exported.

* request.txt: Contains a summary of the parameters that were used for the data export.

 

### Interpreting the Export

#### Users CSV
| Export Field  | Explanation |
|---|---|
| id | User ID |
| name | Users Display Name |
| email | Users E-Mail Address |
| job_title | Users Job Title |
| location | Users Location |
| department | Users Department |
| api_url | The URL used to obtain user metadata ([More information](https://developer.yammer.com/docs/usersidjson)) |
| deleted_by_id | If user was deleted by another user, the ID of the user who performed the deletion |
| deleted_by_type | Describes the method by which the user was deleted |
| joined_at | The date the user first logged into Yammer (In an External Network export, this indicates the date the user joined the network) |
| deleted_at | Date users account was deleted |
| suspended_by_id | The ID of the user who suspended an account |
| suspended_by_type | The method used to suspend a user |
| suspended_at | The date a user was suspended |
| guid | A unique ID generated by your Active Directory for each user. In Yammer, we receive that GUID followinga  successful synchronization |
| state | The current state of the user (active or soft_delete)

<br>
#### NOTE:

A user who is in a soft\_delete state indicates the user is either:

* Pending if there are no joined\_at, suspended\_at, or deleted\_at
    values
* Suspended if the user has a suspended\_at value and not a
    deleted\_at value
* Deleted if the user has a deleted\_at value.

Guest users can be identified in the user export by reviewing the email
address field. Guests would be any user whose email address does not
match the domains that have been added to your network. You can identify
the domains currently merged into your network by navigating to the
Network Migration page under Network Admin. See https://aka.ms/YamNetMig
for additional details on this.
