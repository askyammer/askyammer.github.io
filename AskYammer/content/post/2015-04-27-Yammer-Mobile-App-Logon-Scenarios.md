Yammer offers several different options when it comes to logging in so
you can choose the one that’s best for your organization.  As such,
there are many different login flows you may see depending on which
method is employed on your network.  Below, I have detailed each of
these flows so you can know what to expect for your configuration (note:
Screenshots taken on iOS).

### Office 365 sign-in for Yammer

If you're using Office 365 sign-in for Yammer (more info available
[here](/controlpanel/blogs/posteditor.aspx/1.%20Enter%20your%20email%20address%20in%20the%20first%20page%20and%20hit%20Log%20In%20\(password%20not%20required%20on%20this%20page\))),
you'll see the following flow:

1. Enter your email address in the first page and hit Log In (password
not required on this page)

2. The app will redirect you to the Office 365 sign-in page.  Here, you
will enter your Office 365 credentials (both username and password).  If
your Office 365 tenant uses SSO, you'll be directed to that login page
instead.

### Yammer Authentication

Yammer Authentication is the basic form of authentication and is used
when none of the other options are present for the network or particular
user account logging in.  It consists of just your normal Email and
Password combination and can be entered at the login page as shown
below:
