      <description>Posting messages to Yammer via API is a relatively simple process. When you want to add file attachments into the mix, things get more complicated as you have to utilize multi-part form data to post the message. I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on posting a message to Yammer with an attachment in a single API call. Keep in mind this method only supports attachments up to 25MB in size. If you need to post files larger than 25MB, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use the Yammer web, desktop, or mobile clients for this.</description>
