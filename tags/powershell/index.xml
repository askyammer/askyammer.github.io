      <description>Posting messages to Yammer via API is a relatively simple process. When you want to add file attachments into the mix, things get more complicated as you have to utilize multi-part form data to post the message. I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on posting a message to Yammer with an attachment in a single API call. Keep in mind this method only supports attachments up to 25MB in size. If you need to post files larger than 25MB, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use the Yammer web, desktop, or mobile clients for this.</description>

      <description>With our upcoming move to store Yammer files in SharePoint, we&amp;rsquo;ve received requests from admins to help audit the files currently stored in Yammer. While we don&amp;rsquo;t expect file storage quotas in SharePoint to be an issue, we understand that Yammer admins would like some additional clarity about how much file storage is being used in Yammer. The below PowerShell script will generate a .csv file showing how much data is stored in each Yammer group as well as the total of all files in the Yammer network.</description>

If youâ€™ve never worked with an API before, this can seem like a daunting task. With this article, I hope to demystify APIs and illustrate how anyone can utilize them to perform tasks like obtaining, posting, and deleting messages.
