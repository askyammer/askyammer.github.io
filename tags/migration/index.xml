      <description>Have you recently received an email from Yammer stating that your Office 365 tenant is associated with two or more Yammer networks? If you are wondering what that means and what you can do â€“ we are here to help.
A Yammer network can be associated with an Office 365 tenant in several ways:
 One Office 365 tenant associated with one Yammer network (1 tenant: 1 network) One Office 365 tenant associated with many Yammer networks (1 tenant: many networks) Many Office 365 tenants associated with one Yammer network (many tenants: 1 network)  This document explains in more detail the implications of each of these configurations.</description>
