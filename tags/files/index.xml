      <description>With our upcoming move to store Yammer files in SharePoint, we&amp;rsquo;ve received requests from admins to help audit the files currently stored in Yammer. While we don&amp;rsquo;t expect file storage quotas in SharePoint to be an issue, we understand that Yammer admins would like some additional clarity about how much file storage is being used in Yammer. The below PowerShell script will generate a .csv file showing how much data is stored in each Yammer group as well as the total of all files in the Yammer network.</description>
